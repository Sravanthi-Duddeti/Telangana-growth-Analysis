**Welcome to the Telangana Growth Analysis project! This repository contains all the files and code necessary to understand and visualize the growth metrics of Telangana across different sectors. The project is implemented using Power BI for creating interactive and insightful dashboards.**<br>
# About Telangana
**Telangana, the youngest state in the Union of India, formed on June 2, 2014, comprises 10
districts: Khammam, Nalgonda, Warangal, Karimnagar, Medak, Nizamabad, Aadilabad,
Mahbubnagar, and Hyderabad. The 10 districts have been reorganized into 33 districts from
11th October, 2016. Telangana, with a geographical area of 112,077 square kilometers, and a
population of 35,286,757 (2011 census - 35.28 million), is the 12th largest state in terms of both
area and population in India.<br>
Hyderabad - the capital city and the largest urban center in the state - Telangana is
predominantly rural, with agriculture playing a critical role in its economy. The region is known
for its rich cultural heritage, including traditional arts, crafts, and festivals that reflect the
diverse and vibrant history of the area.
Moreover, Telangana's IT sector has seen significant growth, with Hyderabad emerging as a
major hub for technology and innovation. The establishment of IT parks and special economic
zones has attracted global companies, generating employment and fostering a thriving business
environment.<br>**

## Project Overview
### **Here, we delve into information regarding stamp registration, transportation, and the TS-iPASS initiative.<br>**
## **STAMP REGISTRATION**<br>
Stamp and document registration are essential legal steps in property transactions. Document registration
involves officially recording the property details with the government, making the transaction legally
binding and public. Stamp registration requires paying stamp duty, a tax on property transactions, which
serves as proof of the transaction's legality<br>
## **TRANSPORT ANALYSIS**<br>
Transport analysis in the context of vehicle sales involves a comprehensive study of the patterns, trends,
and impacts of vehicle usage and ownership in the state. This analysis includes examining the data on
vehicle registrations, the types of vehicles being sold, and the demographics of buyers.<br>
## **TS-iPASS (Telangana State Industrial Project Approval and Self-Certification System)**<br>
The scheme of TS-iPASS introduced by the Government of Telangana has indeed set a new benchmark in our
country. Telangana State had ranked 13th in the year 2015-16 in ease of doing business and now has moved
up to 1st rank in the year 2016-17 The online single window system has a provision for filing applications,
payment, status tracking, online scrutiny and approval of applications.**
